Project Initialization

Extract the downloaded archive: Use a tool like WinZip, 7-Zip, or the unzip command to extract the downloaded archive file (e.g., ${projectName}.zip).

Navigate to the project directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the extracted project directory using the cd command (e.g., cd ${projectName}).

Running the project:

Option 1: With Maven (Recommended):

If you already have Maven installed, you can directly use standard Maven commands like mvn package or mvn test to build and potentially run the project (refer to the project documentation for specific commands on how to run the application).

Option 2: Without Maven:

Pre-built Version (if available): The project might offer pre-built versions that include the mvnw and mvnw.cmd scripts for running the project without requiring Maven installation. Check the project website or documentation for download instructions for a pre-built version (if available).

Build Scripts and Run the Project (if source code available):

1. Download a minimal Apache Maven version from the official website: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
2. Extract the downloaded Maven archive into a temporary directory.
3. Open a terminal window (command prompt on Windows).
4. Navigate to the extracted project's root directory using the cd command.
5. (Optional) Run mvn package to see the build process and downloaded dependencies.
6. Generate the wrapper scripts using a specific Maven command (check project documentation for the exact command, a common example might be: mvn wrapper:wrapper).
7. After running the script generation command, check the project's root directory for the newly generated scripts: mvnw (Linux/macOS) and mvnw.cmd (Windows).
8. Run the Project:
- Linux/macOS: With the mvnw script generated, execute the following command in the terminal (assuming the script is executable): ./mvnw
<goal>
    - Windows: With the mvnw.cmd script generated, double-click the script or run it from the command prompt: mvnw.cmd
    <goal>

        Replace
        <goal> with the desired action you want to perform. Here are some common examples:

            ./mvnw package: Builds the project and creates a package (JAR file).
            ./mvnw test: Runs unit tests for the project.
